# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on College Exam Results
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a college exam results dataset to understand student academic performance across different semesters. The analysis helps uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers in student scores.

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Student identifiers (Roll No, Name)

Course and semester details

Subject-wise theory and practical scores

Attendance records

SGPA and CGPA

Result status (Pass/Fail)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Visual Studio 

🔍 Steps Performed

Imported and explored the dataset

Checked dataset shape, columns, and data types

Identified missing and duplicate values

Performed Univariate Analysis (CGPA distribution, result counts)

Performed Bivariate Analysis (CGPA vs SGPA, semester-wise analysis)

Conducted Correlation Analysis using heatmaps

Detected outliers using boxplots
